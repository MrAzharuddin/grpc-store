# **Protoc Commands Execution and explaination**

This is a command used to compile Protocol Buffer definitions (.proto files) into Go code using the Protocol Buffer Compiler (protoc).

```protobuf
protoc --go_out=./pb --go_opt=paths=import --go-grpc_out=./pb --go-grpc_opt=paths=import proto/*.proto
```

Here's what each part of the command does:

* **protoc**: The Protocol Buffer Compiler.
* **--go_out=./pb**: Generates Go code for the Protocol Buffer definitions and saves it to the ./pb directory.
* **--go_opt=paths=import**: Specifies options for the generated Go code. The paths=import option sets the import path for the generated Go code.
* **--go-grpc_out=./pb**: Generates Go code for gRPC based on the Protocol Buffer definitions and saves it to the ./pb directory.
* **--go-grpc_opt=paths=import**: Specifies options for the generated gRPC code. The paths=import option sets the import path for the generated gRPC code.
* **proto/*.proto**: The location of the Protocol Buffer definition files. In this case, it's looking for all .proto files in the proto directory.

## **The difference between --go_opt=paths=import vs --go_opt=paths=source_relative**
**--go_opt=paths=import** refers to the use of absolute import paths. Absolute import paths are used to import packages from a specific location on the file system, for example: "import "github.com/user/project/package".

**--go_opt=paths=source_relative**, on the other hand, refers to the use of relative import paths. Relative import paths are used to import packages relative to the current source file's location, for example: "import "./package".

The difference between these two options is that absolute import paths are less flexible and can lead to issues when importing packages between projects or when sharing code, while relative import paths are more flexible and easier to maintain when moving or sharing code.
